# Agent Configuration

The agent is configured primarily from a YAML file (by default, `/etc/signalfx/agent.yaml`, but this can be overridden by the `-config` command line flag).  

For the full schema of the config, see [Config Schema](./config-schema.md).

## Remote Configuration

See [Remote Configuration](./remote-config.md) for information on how to
configure the agent from remote sources such as other files on the filesystem
or KV stores such as Etcd.
