# cadvisor

 This monitor pulls metrics directly from cadvisor, which
conventionally runs on port 4194, but can be configured to anything.

If you are running containers with Docker, there is a fair amount of
duplication with the `collectd/docker` monitor in terms of the metrics sent
(under distinct metric names) so you may want to consider not enabling the
Docker monitor in a K8s environment, or else use filtering to whitelist only
certain metrics.  Note that this will cause the built-in Docker dashboards
to be blank, but container metrics will be available on the Kubernetes
dashboards instead.
