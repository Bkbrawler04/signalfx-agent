# collectd/kafka

 Monitors a Kafka instance using collectd's
GenericJMX plugin.

This monitor has a set of [built in MBeans
configured](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/kafka/mbeans.go)
for which it pulls metrics from Kafka's JMX endpoint.

See https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-kafka.


[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/kafka)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Default | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` |  | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` |  | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `name` |  | no | `string` |  |
| `serviceName` |  | no | `string` | This is how the service type is identified in the SignalFx UI so that you can get built-in content for it.  For custom JMX integrations, it can be set to whatever you like and metrics will get the dimension `sf_hostHasService` set to this value. |
| `serviceURL` | `service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}/jmxrmi` | no | `string` | The JMX connection string.  This is rendered as a Go template and has access to the other values in this config. |
| `instancePrefix` |  | no | `string` |  |
| `username` |  | no | `string` |  |
| `password` |  | no | `string` |  |
| `mBeansToCollect` |  | no | `list of string` |  |
| `mBeanDefinitions` |  | no | `map of object (see below)` |  |


The **nested** `mBeanDefinitions` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Default | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `objectName` |  | no | `string` |  |
| `instancePrefix` |  | no | `string` |  |
| `instanceFrom` |  | no | `list of string` |  |
| `values` |  | no | `list of object (see below)` |  |


<!--- This is pretty ugly but some config has nesting to three layers.  Would probably be better to flatten them before rendering. --->
The **nested** `values` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Default | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` |  | no | `string` |  |
| `table` | `false` | no | `bool` |  |
| `instancePrefix` |  | no | `string` |  |
| `instanceFrom` |  | no | `string` |  |
| `attribute` |  | no | `string` |  |
