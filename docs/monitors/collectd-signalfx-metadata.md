# collectd/signalfx-metadata

 Collectd Python plugin that aggregates
various metrics from other collectd plugins.  It also sends host metadata to
SignalFx through specially formatted events, and sends active process
("top") lists on a periodic basis.

See [Python plugin code](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-signalfx/) and
[Integrations docs](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/signalfx-metadata).

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `writeServerURL` |  | no | `string` |  |
| `procFSPath` | `/proc` | no | `string` | The path to the proc filesystem. Useful to override in containerized environments. |
| `etcPath` | `/etc` | no | `string` | The path to the main host config dir. Userful to override in containerized environments. |
