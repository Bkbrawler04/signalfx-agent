# jenkins

Monitor Type: `jenkins` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/pkg/monitors/jenkins))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

This monitor collects metrics from the Jenkins Metrics Plugin by hitting these endpoints:
[../api/json](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/jenkins/remote+access+api)
and the plugin [metrics/&lt;MetricsKey&gt;/..](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Metrics+Plugin)
(default and optional Codahale/Dropwizard JVM metrics).

Requires Jenkins 1.580.3 or later, as well as the Jenkins Metrics Plugin (see Setup).

<!--- SETUP --->
## Install Jenkins Metrics Plugin
This monitor requires the Metrics Plugin in Jenkins. Go to `Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> Available -> Search "Metrics Plugin"`
to find and install this plugin in your Jenkins UI.

<!--- SETUP --->
## Example Config

Sample YAML configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/jenkins
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
  metricsKey: reallylongmetricskey
  jenkins_cluster: my_custom_unique_jenkins_identifier
```


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: jenkins
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `httpTimeout` | no | `int64` | HTTP timeout duration for both read and writes. This should be a duration string that is accepted by https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration (**default:** `10s`) |
| `username` | no | `string` | Basic Auth username to use on each request, if any. |
| `password` | no | `string` | Basic Auth password to use on each request, if any. |
| `useHTTPS` | no | `bool` | If true, the agent will connect to the exporter using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP. (**default:** `false`) |
| `httpHeaders` | no | `map of strings` | A map of key=message-header and value=header-value. Comma separated multiple values for the same message-header is supported. |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | If useHTTPS is true and this option is also true, the exporter's TLS cert will not be verified. (**default:** `false`) |
| `caCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the CA cert that has signed the TLS cert, unnecessary if `skipVerify` is set to false. |
| `clientCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS cert to use for TLS required connections |
| `clientKeyPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS key to use for TLS required connections |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host of the jenkins instance |
| `port` | **yes** | `string` | Port of the jenkins instance |
| `metricsKey` | **yes** | `string` | Api key to authenticate to the jenkins metrics plugin |
| `jenkins_cluster` | **yes** | `string` | Dimension with a value that uniquely identifies the jenkins cluster. Jenkins master has no unique identifier, this dimension will be used for that purpose. In addition, the monitor tags the jenkins_cluster dimension with the instance labels. |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


#### Group health
All of the following metrics are part of the `health` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `health` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:
 - ***`jenkins.node.health.disk.space`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Binary value of disk space health
 - ***`jenkins.node.health.plugins`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Boolean value indicating state of plugins
 - ***`jenkins.node.health.temporary.space`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Binary value of temporary space health
 - ***`jenkins.node.health.thread-deadlock`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Boolean value indicating a deadlock

#### Group job
All of the following metrics are part of the `job` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `job` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:
 - ***`jenkins.job.build.count`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    The total number of builds the job ran.
 - ***`jenkins.job.total.time`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    The total builds time for the job.

#### Group node
All of the following metrics are part of the `node` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `node` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:
 - ***`jenkins.node.executor.count`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Total Number of executors in an instance
 - ***`jenkins.node.executor.in-use`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Total number of executors being used in an instance
 - ***`jenkins.node.health-check.score`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Mean health score of an instance
 - ***`jenkins.node.queue.size`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Total number pending jobs in queue
 - ***`jenkins.node.vm.memory.heap.usage`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Percent utilization of the heap memory
 - ***`jenkins.node.vm.memory.non-heap.used`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Total amount of non-heap memory used
 - ***`jenkins.node.vm.memory.total.used`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Total Memory used by instance

#### Group node/status
All of the following metrics are part of the `node/status` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `node/status` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:
 - ***`jenkins.node.online.status`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Boolean value of instance is reachable or not

#### Group slave/status
All of the following metrics are part of the `slave/status` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `slave/status` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:
 - ***`jenkins.node.slave.online.status`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Boolean value for slave is reachable or not

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.

## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by this monitor.  Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.

| Name | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
| `build_result` | Result of the build. |
| `jenkins_cluster` | A user defined value that uniquely identifies the current jenkins instance. |
| `jenkins_version` | The Jenkins version. |
| `job_name` | Name of the job. |
| `job_type` | Type of the job. |
| `slave_name` | Slave display name. |

## Properties

The following
[properties](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/metrics-metadata/metrics-metadata.html#properties)
are set on the dimension values of the dimension specified.

| Name | Dimension | Description |
| ---  | ---       | ---         |
| `<jenkins labels>` | `jenkins_cluster` | The labels will be used as tags against the jenkins_cluster dimension. Note that the label "master", which exists on every master instance, is filtered out. |
