# kubelet-stats

 This monitor pulls cadvisor metrics through a
Kubernetes kubelet instance via the `/stats/container` endpoint.


[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/cadvisor)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Default | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kubeletAPI` | `map[]` | no | `object (see below)` | Kubelet client configuration |
| `logResponses` | `false` | no | `bool` | Whether to log the raw cadvisor response at the debug level for debugging purposes. |


The **nested** `kubeletAPI` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Default | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` |  | no | `string` |  |
| `authType` | `none` | no | `string` |  |
| `skipVerify` | `false` | no | `bool` |  |
| `caCertPath` |  | no | `string` |  |
| `clientCertPath` |  | no | `string` |  |
| `clientKeyPath` |  | no | `string` |  |


<!--- This is pretty ugly but some config has nesting to three layers.  Would probably be better to flatten them before rendering. --->
