# kubernetes-events

This monitor sends Kubernetes events as SignalFx
events. Upon startup, it will send all of the events that K8s has that are
still persisted and then send any new events that come in. The various
agents perform leader election amongs themselves to decide which instance
will send events, unless the `alwaysClusterReporter` config option is set to
true.

You can see the types of events happening in your cluster with `kubectl get
events -o yaml --all-namespaces`.


**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Only One Instance Allowed**: No
